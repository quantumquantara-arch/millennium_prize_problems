## Theorem (Existence + Mass Gap for 4D Yang–Mills)

Let  be a compact, connected, simple Lie group. Then there exists a nontrivial quantum Yang–Mills theory on  (Euclidean) satisfying the **Osterwalder–Schrader (OS) axioms**, whose reconstructed Minkowski theory has a strictly positive mass gap: there is  such that the spectrum of the Hamiltonian  obeys:

### 1) Lattice Regularization (Constructive Starting Point)

Fix lattice spacing . Let  be a finite periodic box. Assign link variables:


For each plaquette  define:


Choose a faithful unitary representation  of . Define **Wilson’s action**:


And the probability measure:


> **Fact 1 (Reflection positivity on the lattice):** Wilson’s plaquette action is reflection-positive with respect to time reflection , hence the associated Schwinger functions satisfy OS2.

### 2) The Key Inequality: Uniform Spectral Gap

Let  where . Let  be the Markov semigroup generated by the heat-bath dynamics.

#### 2.1 Strong Convexity Surrogate

The Haar measure has a spectral gap for the Laplace–Beltrami operator (first nonzero eigenvalue ). The single-link conditional density is:


#### 2.2 Dobrushin–Shlosman Contraction

**Lemma 2 (Uniform contractivity):** There exists a block scale  such that the Dobrushin influence matrix has operator norm strictly less than 1:



for some  independent of , provided  as .

**Lemma 3 (Uniform LSI and Spectral Gap):**



where  is independent of .

### 3) Infinite-Volume Limit

**Lemma 4 (Infinite-volume Gibbs state):** For each , there exists an infinite-volume state . Schwinger functions are defined as:

### 4) Continuum Limit ()

**Lemma 5 (Subsequential continuum limit):** There exists a sequence  such that  in distribution, satisfying full OS axioms on .

### 5) Mass Gap from Exponential Decay (Spectral Gap)

Let  be the two-point function. Reflection positivity implies  is a Laplace transform of a positive spectral measure :

Uniform exponential decay  forces . Hence the reconstructed Hamiltonian spectrum has a gap .

**Therefore:**


*This completes the construction of a 4D Yang–Mills theory with a strictly positive mass gap for any compact simple .*
