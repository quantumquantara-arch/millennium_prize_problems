## Wilson Loop (Gauge-Invariant Observable)
For a closed loop \(\gamma\subset M\),
\[
W(\gamma) = \mathrm{Tr}\left(\mathcal{P}\exp \oint_\gamma A\right),
\]
where \(\mathcal{P}\) denotes path-ordering.

## Mass Gap Predicate (Abstract Spectral Form)
Let \(\mathcal{H}\) be a Hilbert space and \(H\) a self-adjoint operator with vacuum energy normalized to 0.
Define:
\[
\mathrm{MassGap}(H) \iff \exists \Delta>0:\ \mathrm{Spec}(H)\subset \{0\}\cup[\Delta,\infty).
\]
No construction of \(H\) is asserted here.
