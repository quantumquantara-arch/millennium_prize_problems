## Repo
coherence_spacetime_lattice

## Goal
Extract verbatim definitions/claims that can be typed into:
- weighted directed graph (lattice core)
- state space S and functionals κ, τ, Σ
- any positivity/monotonicity constraints
- any discrete-to-continuum statements (must be explicit)

## Evidence Log
(append items; do not interpret without snippets)
