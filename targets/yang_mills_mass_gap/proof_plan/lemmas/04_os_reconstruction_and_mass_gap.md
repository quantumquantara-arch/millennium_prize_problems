## Goal
Reconstruct the Minkowski theory and prove the mass gap from Euclidean exponential decay.

## Lemma REC-L1 (OS reconstruction)
Statement:
- From OS axioms obtain (H, Ω, fields) with reflection positivity giving a Hilbert space.
Inputs:
- Standard OS reconstruction theorem (must be instantiated for this field content).

## Lemma MG-L1 (Exponential decay ⇒ spectral gap)
Statement:
- For gauge-invariant operator O with ⟨O⟩=0,
  if ⟨O(t)O(0)⟩ ≤ C e^{-m t} then Spec(H) ∩ (0,m) = ∅.

Deliverable:
- Mass gap Δ ≥ m > 0 in reconstructed Hamiltonian.
