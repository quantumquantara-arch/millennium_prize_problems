## Goal
Define the continuum limit precisely and prove OS0–OS4 for the limiting Schwinger functions.

## Lemma OS-L0 (Regularity / bounds)
Statement:
- Uniform bounds (in a) placing S_n^(a) in a compact set of distributions.
- Tightness / precompactness under chosen topology.

## Lemma OS-L1 (Euclidean invariance)
Statement:
- Invariance under E(4) for the limit S_n.
Inputs:
- Approximation from lattice symmetries + regularity.

## Lemma OS-L3 (Symmetry)
Statement:
- Permutation symmetry in arguments/fields passes to limit.

## Lemma OS-L4 (Cluster)
Statement:
- Clustering passes to limit; exponential clustering if uniform.

Deliverable:
- A single “Continuum Limit Theorem” with explicit assumptions and proofs.
