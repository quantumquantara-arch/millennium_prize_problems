# AUREON_APEX_RULES — Invariant Spine for Millennium-Grade Work

This repository is governed by invariant-first reasoning. No step proceeds unless invariants are explicit, preserved, and auditable.

## 0. Prime Directive
Reduce entropy while preserving truth: maximize insight density per energetic cost (AEI), minimize drift, and never invent missing structure.

## 1. Non-Negotiable Invariants (κ–τ–Σ)
### κ (Coherence)
- Every statement must be derivable from explicit definitions, cited sources, or formally stated assumptions.
- No metaphor may substitute for a definition.

### τ (Temporal Discipline)
- No uncontrolled branching. Each step must shorten future proof paths or be rejected.
- If recursion repeats without new information, invoke Zero Return (reset to last stable anchor).

### Σ (Risk Curvature)
- Reject any expansion that increases systemic ambiguity, contradiction risk, or unverifiable claims.
- Prefer smallest sufficient formal kernel over broad narratives.

## 2. Admissible Evidence
A construct enters the pipeline only if it includes:
- Source path(s) in the originating repo(s)
- Exact snippet(s)
- Normalization note (symbols, units, implicit assumptions)
- Classification:
  - A: established mathematics
  - B: novel/speculative (must be defined)
  - C: ambiguous/undefined (blocked)

## 3. Hard Prohibitions
- No claims of solving any Millennium problem.
- No “proof language” without formal definitions.
- No replacing missing lemmas with intuitive explanations.
- No pretending simulations are proofs.
- No moving from lattice/discrete to continuum without explicit limit statements.

## 4. Mandatory Gating Before Formalization
A construct may be formalized only after passing all gates:
1. Definition Gate: terms are defined without circularity.
2. Typing Gate: objects have mathematical types (manifold, bundle, operator, functional, etc.).
3. Equivalence Gate: mapping to standard objects is stated precisely (or marked speculative).
4. Consistency Gate: no internal contradictions under stated assumptions.

## 5. Output Grammar (Audit-Ready)
Every extracted item MUST include:
- ID: REPOnn-CONSTRUCTnn
- Source: repo/path:line-range (or permalink)
- Snippet: exact text/code
- Proposed Math Object: (e.g., principal bundle connection, curvature 2-form, Wilson loop, action functional)
- Classification: A/B/C
- Missing Definitions: bullet list
- Next Action: define / translate / reject / defer

## 6. Zero Return Protocol (Stall/Loop Break)
Invoke Zero Return when:
- repeated cycles produce no new definitions
- ambiguity compounds
- Σ risk increases
Action:
- revert to last stable anchor file
- restate invariants
- continue with the smallest unresolved definition

## 7. Success Criteria (This Repo)
- All core concepts rewritten as standard mathematical objects.
- Lean/Coq stubs compile for the foundational layer (types + definitions).
- Clear “Missing Proof Inventory” exists for any Millennium-problem mapping.
